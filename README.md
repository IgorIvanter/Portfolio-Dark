# Description

This is a free online guide on learning the basics of German. I purposefully didn't use any libraries, just plain HTML and CSS, and that helped me to learn a lot of CSS.

# What I learned:

- More advanced CSS

- Adding multiple CSS files to one page

- Responsive design

- Simple animations
